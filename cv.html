    <h3>General information about myself</h3>
    <p>My name is Mario Killar and I am 19 years old. I am from Austria and I lived there up until I was 17 which was now 2 years ago where I then decided to move in with a friend's family here in England to continue my studies. This means I am fluent in both written and spoken German and English.</p>
    <p> I learned to speak English through learning it in school as well as being very invested in online gaming where I talked to a lot of English speaking people which has also helped a lot, as school in Austria heavily focused on learning vocabulary and writing, rather than actually speaking the language.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    <p>My main interest is in computers. I have been focusing my education on learning new interesting things about computers because it is what I enjoy doing. In my free time I will usually play games on my computer with friends, especially now because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>Before the pandemic I also enjoyed meeting up with friends to mess around and have a fun time, go to the cinema or play football.</p>

    <h3> Education</h3>
    <p>I attended school in Austria from the age of 16 until 17, when I moved to England. Once I moved to England I first started a Level 3 IT Apprenticeship, but I then later realised that I would rather go back to school, which is what I did. I attended Northampton College where I did the OCR Introduction Infrastructure Technician Level 3 course for 2 years. I achieved a Distinction and Distinction, which I was very happy with. </p>
    
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>One of the most important skills that I have I think are that I am great at working by myself and also working together with a team to reach a specific goal. I always do my work on time, because I believe it is important to stay on top of your work and be organised.  </p>
