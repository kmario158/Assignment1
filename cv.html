    <h3>General information about myself</h3>
    <p>My name is Mario Killar and I am 19 years old. I am from Austria and I lived there up until I was 16 which was now 3 years ago where I then decided to move in with a friend's family here in England to continue my studies. This means I am fluent in both written and spoken German and English.</p>
    <p> I learned to speak English through learning it in school as well as being very invested in online gaming where I talked to a lot of English speaking people which has also helped a lot, as school in Austria heavily focused on learning vocabulary and writing, rather than actually speaking the language.</p>
